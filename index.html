    <h1>Skibbidi Gyattcycle 🚴‍♂️💨</h1>
    <p>
      A bike traffic tracker for the Boston area—pan, zoom, and filter through
      260,000 rides from March 2024. Green lines are bike lanes, circles show
      BlueBike station traffic (bigger = busier), and colors tell you if more
      people are pulling up or heading out. Basically, it’s Google Maps but with
      gyatt-level bike stats.
